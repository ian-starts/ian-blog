Some time ago I listened to a [podcast](https://samharris.org/podcasts/137-safe-space/) about Jonathan Haidt's 
book *[The Coddling of the American Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224897)*.
They discuss the origins of his book, which basically boiled down to this: In some American universities the 
students feel victimized over (usually unintended) harsh comments. **The original intention of the comment becomes 
second rate to how the students perceive them.** Jonathan Haidt characterizes this as the opposite of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.

This got me thinking about CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) and drove my down a deep rabbit hole of a 
gorgeous psychotherapy, rooted in stoicism.

Pim and I recently started making an app around CBT called Parley. I thought it would be cool to share what we've learned and
 walk through the steps we thought were most important (and thus implemented in Parley).

## What is CBT
There has been a lot written on CBT but here's an extremely short summary anyway.

CBT tries to give you the methods to influence your thoughts. The 
idea is that your thoughts, feelings and actions are interconnected. Changing one of those will shift all three. 

It can show you why some negative thoughts are not rooted in reality. By making those thought more 
realistic they usually lose their negativity. If they keep being negative it can be a strong motivator for
 concrete action instead of being paralyzing.  
 
If you want to know more I'd really recommend reading *[Feeling Good](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-
Therapy/dp/0380731762/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=feeling+good&qid=1582720859&s=books&sr=1-1)* by Dr. David Burns.


## Step one: Write down the event
It's important to compartmentalize the situations where you feel bad. This could be very related to a painful situation
 (eg: being told by your boss the other day that you're fired), or much more vague ("I was sitting at my 
 desk and was suddenly overwhelmed by grief"). The important thing is that it's always **one** moment. 
 It should't be: "I just feel sad all the time".
 
## Step two: Write down all the thoughts occurred to you at the time
